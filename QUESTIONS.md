# Question 1


TensorFlow and PyTorch are like two different toolkits for building smart computer programs that learn from data (aka deep learning). Think of them as different brands of LEGO sets for AI.
Here’s the deal:
- PyTorch is like building with regular LEGOs—you can add or change pieces as you build. That’s great if you're experimenting or trying out new ideas. It's very flexible and feels more like regular Python code, which is why a lot of researchers and students love it.
- TensorFlow, on the other hand, used to be more like building with a blueprint—you had to plan everything before you started snapping pieces together. But now, with TensorFlow 2, it’s much more flexible and behaves more like PyTorch.
When it comes to getting your creation out into the real world (like putting your LEGO masterpiece on display), TensorFlow has more tools to help you do that—whether you're putting it in an app, a website, or a big production system. PyTorch is catching up, though.
In short:
- PyTorch = easy to use, great for trying things out.
- TensorFlow = powerful for real-world deployment, with strong support tools.

# Question 2
1. Exploring and Cleaning Data (EDA and Preprocessing)
Jupyter Notebooks are super helpful when you're just getting started with your data. You can:
- Look at the data to understand what’s inside
- Fix any missing or messy parts
- Make graphs and charts to spot trends
And the best part? You can run small chunks of code and see the results instantly, so it’s easy to test and adjust things as you go.
2. Trying Out AI Models (Prototyping and Experimenting)
Once your data is ready, Jupyter is also great for building your AI model. You can:
- Write and test different models using tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Keep notes alongside your code to explain what you're doing
- See how well your models perform and compare results
It’s like a digital lab notebook where you test ideas quickly and share your work with teammates.
